\section{\scshape{Introduction}}

\subsection{Purpose Of The System}
It is very frustrating as a customer to arrive at a restaurant to and find that all tables are taken, and you have to wait for hours before you can get a table. Sometimes even if you try to book in advance by calling the restaurant,  the call does not go through or is never picked up.\\\\
The purpose of this project is to create a system that will replace the human effort, on the restaurant staff side, of having to manually take bookings.The system will enable customers to make restaurant bookings via their android mobile devices wherever they are.
 
\subsection{Scope Of The System}
The Restaurant booking system is a sofware application from which patrons will be able to book tables, view the menu, order food, make bill payments and even rate the restaurant`s service.\\\\
The system will be running on android mobile devices.

\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}
The main objective of this project is;
\begin{itemize}
\item To create a system that will enable customers to book tables online
\end{itemize}
Additional features of the system are;
\begin{itemize}
\item Users can view the menu and specials for the day
\item Users can keep track of their bill 
\item Users can order online
\item Users can check whether their table is ready for occupying
\end{itemize}
During the process of designing this system, the software designers will be liasing with the restaurant staff and willing restaurant customers constantly to test the current prototype.\\\\
Success will be achieved if the following goals are met;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users are happy with and can easily use the interface without any training
	\item The instruction manual answers all user queries
	\item The system eliminates any kind of interaction between restaurant staff and customers where booking of tables is concerned
	\item More than 80 percent of the test subjects approve and say they will be using the application everytime they visit the restaurant
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations}

%\subsection{Overview}

\section{\scshape{Current system}}
Currently, restaurant bookings can only be made via a phone call or directly at the restaurant. The restaurant has only a single extension for this and during peak periods, the staff fails to handle all potential customers booking on the phone.\\\\
The menu is printed on a cardboard paper and updating it requires printing a new set of menus and laminating them.\\\\
After decicding on what to eat, the customer has to wait for the waiter to come back to them and take their order.\\\\
The customer then asks for and pays their their bill after they are done eating.\\\\

\section{\scshape{Proposed System}}
\subsection{Overview}
The whole aim of the proposed system is to automatize most of the restaurant`s processeses so as to make the restaurant run more efficiently.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{}The system shall allow restaurant staff and customers to register as users.
\subsubsection{}The system shall allow restaurant staff and customers to log in.
\subsubsection{}The system shall give staff and customers different user priviledges.
\subsubsection{}The system shall make available an updated menu for users to choose what to order.
\subsubsection{}The system shall allow users to make table bookings.
\subsubsection{}The system shall enable users to order food online.

\subsection{Non Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be usable on more than 70 percent of Android devices
	\item Instructions on the system must be unambiguous 
	\item The user must be able to log in and out of their account on any device
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be able to handle the growing number of new users on a daily basis without losing perfomance since one of the aims of the restaurant is to get as many customers as possible.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The software must be bug free by the time it is distributed for public use.
	\item Each user account must be secure and unique.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Perfomance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphics and text must be clear.
	\item Logging in must be instantaneous with no flaws
\end{itemize}
	 
\subsubsection{Supportability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item On the first release, the application must run on any Android KitKat or later releases 
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Implementation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The project must be implemented on Android.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Interface}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The interface must be attractive, simple and easy to use.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Packaging}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The System must be packaged and distributed freely on the Google Play Store
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Legal}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system must direct the user to the Terms and conditions page which the user must read and accept before installing the application.
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{System Models}
\subsubsection{Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Bob wants to make an online reservation to dine at FLCKZ restaurant\\in the evening.
	\item He acquires the Restaurant booking system on google store using his mobile phone and installs it.\\
	\item He signs up by proving his identification details.
	\item He uses the details he provided to identify himself and gain access to the system.
	\item He makes a reservation for a specific date and time.
	\item He then closes the system.
\end{enumerate}
